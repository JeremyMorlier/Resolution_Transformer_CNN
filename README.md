# Resolution_Tranformer_CNN
The goal of this repository is to provide code to experiment the importance of resolution on CNN and Transformers in the context of image classification and semantic segmentation

```bash
python3 train_resnet50.py --data-path PATH_TO_IMAGENET_DATASET --train-crop-size 176  --val-resize-size 232
```
